I'm a third-year PhD candidate in the Division for Computational and Data Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis. I am a member of the Center for Population Health Informatics, directed by Randi Foraker, PhD, MA, FAHA, which is part of the Institute for Informatics (I2) at Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine. 

My professional interests surround using machine learning and data science methods to predict whether patients will be diagnosed with autoimmune diseases in the future. I'm also interested in characterizing their prevalence, how they cluster both within patients and across different populations, and identifying common comorbidities with autoimmune diseases. Beyond that, I'm interested in learning more about how algorithmic bias in health care settings perpetuates health disparities at both the individual and community levels.

My personal interests include playing fetch for hours on end with my shiba inu, Nobi, and reading any books I can get my hands on. I'm an avid board gamer and LEGO builder, and I am always trying to get better at playing the piano.

I'm a first-year PhD student in the Division for Computational and Data Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis. I am a member of the Center for Population Health Informatics, directed by Randi Foraker, PhD, MA, FAHA, which is part of the Institute for Informatics (I2) at Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine. 

I am interested in using electronic health records at scale to learn how social determinants of health influence health outcomes in clinical settings.
